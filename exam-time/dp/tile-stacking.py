"""
A stable tower of height n is a tower consisting of exactly n tiles of unit height stacked vertically in such a way,
that no bigger tile is placed on a smaller tile.
We have an infinite number of tiles of sizes 1, 2, â€¦, m. The task is to calculate the number of the different stable
towers of height n that can be built from these tiles, with a restriction
that you can use at most k tiles of each size in the tower.
Note: Two towers of height n are different if and only if there exists a height h (1 <= h <= n),
such that the towers have tiles of different sizes at height h.
