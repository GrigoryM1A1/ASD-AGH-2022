"""
Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm}
valued coins, how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.
For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}. So output should be 4.
For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, there are five solutions: {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}.
So the output should be 5.
