"""
Given an array arr[0 â€¦ n-1] containing n positive integers, a subsequence of arr[] is called Bitonic if it is first
increasing, then decreasing. Write a function that takes an array as argument and returns the length of
the longest bitonic subsequence.
A sequence, sorted in increasing order is considered Bitonic with the decreasing part as empty. Similarly, decreasing
order sequence is considered Bitonic with the increasing part as empty.
